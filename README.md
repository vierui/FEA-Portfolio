# FEA Portofolio

This portfolio highlights diverse FEA projects and analysis encompassing linear and nonlinear static analysis, fatigue cycles analysis or buckling across metallic structures.

#### Technical stack
CAD & Design : NX, Inventor

Solvers : Nastran, CalculiX

Pre-/Post-Processing : NX, PrePomax


## Extrusion process simulation 
2D Axisymmetric analysis of a copper extrusion process.

**GOAL**  


## Watch components analysis
The crown wheel transmits the winding motion to the mainspring. The click-spring), is a ratchet mechanism that prevents the mainspring from unwinding, thus retaining the energy stored during winding



## Aerospace panel buckling analysis
Buckling analysis of FA-18 wing panels modeled as shells.
GOAL : The study compares linear (Nastran solver 101) and nonlinear (Nastran solver 402) approaches for real-world application.



## Housing and flange from linear actuator analysis
