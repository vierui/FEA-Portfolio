## Extrusion procession simulation 


## Watch components analysis
The crown wheel transmits the winding motion to the mainspring. The click-spring), is a ratchet mechanism that prevents the mainspring from unwinding, thus retaining the energy stored during winding



## Aerospace panel buckling analysis
