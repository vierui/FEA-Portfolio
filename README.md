## [2D Axisymmetric analysis of a copper extrusion process](https://github.com/vierui/FEA-Portfolio/tree/main/stat-housing-flange/README.dm "Extrusion process")
2D Axisymmetric analysis of a copper extrusion process.

## [Watch components analysis](https://github.com/vierui/FEA-Portfolio/stat-housing-flange/README.dm "Buckling aeropspace panel")
Watch components analysis
The crown wheel transmits the winding motion to the mainspring. The click-spring), is a ratchet mechanism that prevents the mainspring from unwinding, thus retaining the energy stored during winding



## [Aerospace panel buckling analysis](https://github.com/vierui/FEA-Portfolio/stat-housing-flange/README.dm "Buckling aeropspace panel")
Buckling analysis of FA-18 wing panels modeled as shells.
GOAL : The study compares linear (Nastran solver 101) and nonlinear (Nastran solver 402) approaches for real-world application.
